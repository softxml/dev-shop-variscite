== 🌟 Why Use Product Feed Manager for WooCommerce? 🌟 ==

Product Feed Manager is the one-stop solution for your WooCommerce product feeds for Google Shopping and **180+ popular marketplaces**.

Create accurate WooCommerce feeds in just a few steps, without having to spend hours on documentation.

The plugin comes with a super easy UI that helps you understand the feed generation process even without any in-depth technical knowledge.

You also get pre-configured WooCommerce feed templates for all the supported merchants so that you do not need to manually create the whole feed from scratch.

In fact, you can literally start from zero and create perfect product feeds in as low as **3 simple steps**!

1. Select Your Preferred Merchant
2. Configure Product Data For Your Feed
3. Generate Feed With Clicking The Publish Button.

And that’s it. It's That Easy! 🤩

== 🌟 Customize Product Feeds 🌟 ==

Getting pre-made feed templates is only one aspect of Product Feed Manager.

But you can do so much more with it such as, 

- Add additional product data,
- Category mapping with Google's category, 
- Advanced filter options to generate feed with selected products, 
- Create a custom feed for merchants that we do have a template for.

==🌟 Automate Feed Generation Processs 🌟==

You can also automate the feed generation process whenever you make changes to your store such as,

- Adding a new product, or 
- Changing product details, etc

And to do that you can use its scheduled update feature.

== 🌟 Who Can Use Product Feed Manager For WooCommerce 🌟 ==

The plugin is designed to make it easy for both beginners and advanced users.

Whether you are starting as a **beginner** and have little knowledge of feed requirements for marketplaces, or an **advanced user** who wants to customize the feed data, we got you covered.

With Product Feed Manager For WooCommerce we want to ensure that you, as the user, is the first priority.

That is why we always provide high-quality support and constantly work on improving the plugin with new and improved features to make life easier for you when it comes to promoting your products on online marketplaces.

Following are all the core features that we have released over the years to make this plugin the best Product Feed Management solution for your business.

**👉 Auto-sync with Google Shopping**

You can auto-sync your store products with Google Merchant Shop (Google Shopping).

You can set it up so that your generated product feed (product data feed) will automatically be updated and sent to your Google Merchant Shop as per your schedule.

You do not need to download and upload the feed for <a href="https://rextheme.com/best-woocommerce-product-feed/google-product-feed/
?utm_source=pfm_repo&utm_medium=google_landing_url&utm_campaign=wp_repo" target="_blank">Google Shopping Center</a> manually.

**👉 Category Mapping (Not Limited To Google)**

Google requires you to set your products under their fixed Category Lists. But changing your own store's categories is not necessary.

You can use the category mapping feature to map your store categories according to Google's.

So your store's categories will still be the same while your products will be placed under the relevant Google category on the product feed.

You can use it to map product categories for other sites as well (i.e., > *it is not limited to Google Shopping*).

It used to be a required field for generating WooCommerce product feeds for Google merchants and Google Shopping, but now this is an optional field.

> *Not only does it support 1-to-1 category mapping but you can also map subsets of products on a merchant-category based on product names.*

**👉 Extensive Filter Options**

You can use the smooth filter options to include or exclude the required products of your store from the product feed.

You can filter by **categories**, **tags**, or **apply custom filters** using other attributes.

You also get custom filter options. Now you can generate feed more precisely using new Product Creation Date & Product Last Modified Date conditions for Custom Filter.


**👉 Schedule Auto Update Of the Product Feed**

Any changes you make to product data, you can set a schedule for your product feed to be updated automatically.

You do not need to manually update the product feed every time you make changes to your products.

**👉 Supports Various Product Feed File Types**

With our WooCommerce product feed plugin, you can create different types of feed files according to your merchant needs.

With selecting your merchant, you can also select what type of feed you want to generate.

Our supported feed type includes:

- **XML** Product feed
- **CSV** Product feed
- **TEXT** Product feed
- **TSV** Product feed
- **RSS** Product feed

**👉 Advanced Custom Fields**

WooCommerce doesn't provide certain fields such as 

**Brand, GTIN, UPC, Age-group, Gender**, etc.

However, Many merchant shops require this data.

Hence, Product Feed Manager for WooCommerce creates these custom fields for you so that you can generate accurate product feed without any extra coding or plugins.

It will save you time and create clean quality product feed to promote through other merchant shopping channels.

**👉 Exclusive WooCommerce Variable Product & Variation Options**

If you have variable products in your WooCommerce site, you can easily choose between parent products and variations to show in your feed.

In our WooCommerce product feed plugin, you’ll get these options -

- Include Only Parent ProductS (without variations)
- Include Variation Name In The Product Title
- Include All Variable Products Variations

You can just select the option and include variable products with or without parent products however you want.

**👉 Create A Custom Feed For Any Merchant**

The custom feed option will allow you to create a personalized feed for any marketplace you want.

The custom WooCommerce feed option will help you to -

- Select your preferred feed attributes
- Choose a custom feed type
- Include/Exclude XML header
- Add Wrapper Element
- Add Item Wrapper

So, if you’re wondering how to create a localized feed or a complex feed with specific attributes you can do this easily with the option.

**👉 Google Analytics Support**

You can add and configure Google Analytics UTM tracking codes to your product URLs.

It will allow you to measure the effectiveness of marketing channels in Google Analytics.

**👉 Track Products With Facebook Pixel**

With Facebook Pixel, you can track:

- Simple product pages
- Variable product and variations pages
- Category pages

- Add to cart button
- Thank you page


>  You will get a **reliable support team** to help you out at all times and detailed [documentation](https://rextheme.com/docs/WooCommerce-product-feed/) and [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYRgnMFQGH8&list=PLelDqLncNWcVoPA7T4eyyfzTF0i_Scbnq).

**👉 Combine Multiple Attributes In The Feed**

You can now merge different attributes in a single attribute, to show in your WooCommerce XML product feed.

*For example, in the **product title**, you can add a brand name to attract your targeted audience without manually changing it.*

Create more descriptive and keyword-rich product titles, to help your products rank higher in search engines and attract more organic traffic to your sites.

==🌟 ACF Support 🌟==
Get [Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) plugin's custom fields support in Product Feed Manager For WooCommerce.

You can not only generate feeds but also fetch custom images using ACF to your product feed easily without any hassle.
